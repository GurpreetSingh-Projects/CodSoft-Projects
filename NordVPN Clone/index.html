          NordVPN was launched by childhood friends in 2012. They had
          <br />spent a lot of time in different parts of the world, but saw the
          <br />same picture: growing internet censorship, content control, and
          <br />intrusive government surveillance. In other words, they saw a
          <br />rapidly growing need for an internet security tool that’s
          <br />easily accessible to everyone.

            Audits can reveal weaknesses — and strengths. We routinely submit
            our apps to independent researchers for thorough security testing,
            fixing any flaws uncovered. We also rigorously audit our vendors for
            reliability. Finally, NordVPN was the first VPN to have its no-log
            policy audited independently — a practice that has since been
            adopted by the rest of the VPN industry.
